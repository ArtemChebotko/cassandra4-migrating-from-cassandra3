# Migrating from Cassandra 3.x to 4.x

## Learn how to upgrade an Apache CassandraÂ® cluster from 3.x to 4.x.

You will learn how to upgrade a Cassandra cluster from 3.x to 4.x. To For simplicity, you will perform a migration of a *single-node* cluster. Production Cassandra clusters always have multiple nodes. Therefore, steps have notes describing the *extra* work necessary to upgrade *multi-node* clusters.

**In this hands-on lab, you will:**
- Configure a single node Cassandra 3.x cluster
- Populate this cluster with data
- Prepare the cluster for upgrade
- Install Cassandra 4.x
- Start Cassandra 4.x cluster
- Verify that the data has upgraded to the Cassandra 4.x cluster

_This hands-on lab is available on our [https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4](https://www.datastax.com/learn/whats-new-for-cassandra-4) site, where you can find many more resources to help you succeed with Apache Cassandra._
